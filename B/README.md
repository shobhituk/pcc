## Chapter B - Variables and Simple Data Types

### **B001 - `Hello World` again but not on interpreter**

> Instead of running on interpreter, create a file named B001.py and print string welcome message "Hello World!".


*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B001.py
  Hello World!
```

### **B002 - Introducing variables**

> Store the above message "Hello World!" in a variable, and then print that
  message.

*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B002.py
  Hello World!
```

### **B003 - Variables are meant to be changed**

> Store message "Hello World!" in a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of your variable to a new message "Hello Python World!", and print the new message.

*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B003.py
  Hello World!
  Hello Python World!
```

### **B004 - Personal Greetings**

> Now is the time to greet your friend personally. Create a new file B004.py, store your friends name in a variable and say Hola! to your friend. Print a simple message such as `Hello Messi!`, `Hola, Ekta` etc.

*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B004.py
  Hello messi!
  Hola, ekta
```

### **B005 - Use Uppercase above**

> In the above example `B004` make first letter of your friends name a capital letter. Keep in mind to use same variable as in previous example and use string manipulation methods to convert to uppercase first letter.

*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B005.py
  Hello Messi!
  Hola, Ekta
```

### **B006 - Print a quote**

> Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:

*Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”*

> Print this above message as it is.


*SAMPLE_RUN: &nbsp;&nbsp;#01*

```bash
  $ python B006.py
  Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
```

### **B007 - Datatypes**

> Write a program to print five different variables. Each of these variables are five different data types namely, an integer, a float, a string, a list and a dictionary.

*SAMPLE_RUN #01*

```bash
  $ python B007.py
  11
  14.0
  "some random string"
  ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
  {"foo": "FOO", "bar": "BAR", "baz": "BAZ"}
```

### **B008 - Working with Numbers**

> Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines each printing `8`.

*SAMPLE_RUN #01*

```bash
  $ python B008.py
  8
  8
  8
  8
```
